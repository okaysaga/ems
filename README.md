## Introduction

The Election Management System backend is developed to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing election-related tasks. It is built using [insert technologies or frameworks used, e.g., Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB].

## Features

- **Voter Management**: Register and manage voters' information securely.
- **Candidate Management**: Add, update, and remove candidates running for election.
- **Polling Station Setup**: Set up polling stations and assign staff accordingly.
- **Result Tabulation**: Automatically calculate and tabulate election results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure environment variables such as database connection string, JWT secret, etc.
4. **Run the Application**: `npm start`

## Usage

Once the backend is up and running, you can interact with it via HTTP requests. Below are some common tasks and examples of how to perform them:

### Register a Voter

```http
POST /api/voters/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "address": "123 Main St, City",
  "voterId": "VOT123456789"
}
```

### Add a Candidate

```http
POST /api/candidates
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "party": "XYZ Party",
  "position": "President"
}
```

### Get Election Results

```http
GET /api/results
```

For more detailed documentation on available endpoints and request/response formats, refer to the [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) section.
